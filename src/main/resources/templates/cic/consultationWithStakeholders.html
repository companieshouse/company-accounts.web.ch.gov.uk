                                                <p>We ask everyone using the shop for the first time to fill in a short questionnaire about their shopping habits. This has helped us to build up a profile of local consumers’ needs and what we can do to meet them more effectively. Our research has enabled us to identify that there are about 120 households in the village without access to cars or where residents have impaired mobility, and a further 200 or so households who now use the shop for at least 40 per cent of their grocery shopping. We encourage those working in the shop to pick up ideas for the business when talking to customers and we keep a “suggestions box” for customers to provide details of products which they would like to see stocked in the shop.</p>',
