                <p class="govuk-body-l">There are currently two other ways to file full or abridged
                    company accounts to Companies House:</p>
                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Using the Companies House-HMRC joint filing service</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to use your Government Gateway account or register if you
                    don’t have one. This method lets you file your tax return to HMRC at the same time.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Using a third party software</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">This service is open to everyone, but will mostly benefit those who
                    file frequently - on a daily or weekly basis. The more documents you file, the more
                    appropriate software filing is likely to be.
